# BSO-FS
The first version of this project was a python translation for an original JAVA project of Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) algorithm used in Feature Selection (FS), then we improved it, and added the a class for reinforcement learning algorithms.

If you want to try it, all you have to do is create a virtual enviornment using virtualenv or virtualenv-wrapper or anaconda ( for the lazy ones ) with a <b>python 3.6+</b> version, and install the packages in the <b>requirements.txt</b> file using :

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

Please, if you have any comments or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me at : <ea_remache@esi.dz>

Or a second option is to use the notebook in Colab.
