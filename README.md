# QBSO-FS : a Reinforcement Learning based Bee Swarm Optimization metaheuristic for Feature Selection

The first version of this project was a python translation for an original JAVA project of Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) algorithm used in Feature Selection (FS), then we improved it by optimizing a lot of aspects, then we added a class for reinforcement learning algorithms, which is the main work of this project. 

If you want to try it in your local machine, all you have to do is create a virtual enviornment using virtualenv or virtualenv-wrapper or anaconda ( for the lazy ones ) with a <b>python 3.6+</b> version, and install the packages in the <b>requirements.txt</b> file using :

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

Or you could rune one of the [notebooks](https://github.com/Neofly4023/bso-fs/tree/master/notebooks) in a Jupyter environement like [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
